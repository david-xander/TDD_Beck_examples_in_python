# TDD Beck's book examples in python
Just to keep coding while reading it as I did with Percival's TDD book of the fancy goat, not the refactoring cat :)

I realized at ch7 that it'd be better to break things into steps.

So, everything up to ch6 is in "ch1-ch6" folder. Then I started to split into chapters.
